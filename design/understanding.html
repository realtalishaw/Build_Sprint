												                                <p>The ‚ÄúHow Might We‚Äù or HMW method is an essential Design Sprint methodology. At Google, we use it to capture opportunities during lightning talks and throughout the Understand phase. This method allows your team to take the insights and pain points they hear and positively reframe them. HMWs create an active framework for resolving the challenges.

It‚Äôs important to explain to your team how the HMW process works before Lightning Talks begin. Make sure the team understands they are looking for opportunities rather than solutions. Each word of the HMW phrase puts team members in the right mindset:</p>
<ul>
<li>‚ÄúHow‚Äù guides team members to believe the answer is out there.</li>
<li>‚ÄúMight‚Äù lets team members know their HMW statement might or might not work, and either possibility is okay</li>
<li>‚ÄúWe‚Äù reminds team members that the Design Sprint is about teamwork and building on each others‚Äô ideas</li>
</ul>
<p>Do not spend a lot of time crafting or perfecting HMW statements. Instead, encourage your team to come up with as many HMW notes as they can, with as little self-editing as possible. This is an exercise in expansive thinking aimed at preventing the team from arriving at premature solutions.</p>

												                                <p>Some Design Sprints may include user interviews in the Understand phase to inject first-hand user perspectives into the Sprint. User interviews rely on stories to explore emotions,understand user goals, and assess needs. The goal of the interview is to gain empathy for the user‚Äôs experience. Through that empathy, we can shape the design solutions to fit the use better.</p>

<p>For example, if you are working on a new project on digital watches, you might want to know how people currently keep track of time. What do they use? What do they like? What is a pain point?</p>

<p>Two other, similar interview types to consider for your Design Sprint are Expert Interviews and Stakeholder Interviews..</p>

												                               <p>User Journey Mapping is a common Design Sprint method that maps out a user‚Äôs experience step by step as they encounter your problem space or interact with your product. This method enables the team to get into the mindset of the user and illuminates pain points, identifying opportunities to create new or improved user experiences.</p>
                                                        <p>Journey maps are often for a specific type of user, also known as a persona. If there many users or players involved in the Design Sprint‚Äôs problem space, multiple journey maps may be required, one for each user type.</p>
                                                        <p>How to start a journey map depends on where you are in your product cycle. If you‚Äôre doing a Design Sprint for a new product and/or you are in the early stages of the product cycle, you may want to explore a certain use case for your product and start your journey map with the user‚Äôs initial entry point into that use case. If you have an existing product and are further along in the cycle, you may start your journey map when the user is first introduced to your product, when they‚Äôre searching for your product, or when they are onboarding and/or setting up an account.</p>

												                                <p>The Comparable Problem method is a great warm up for the Sketch phase of the Design Sprint. Sometimes the best ideas already exist‚Äîthey simply need to be repurposed, presented in a new context, or combined with other ideas. Ask team members to research industries related or in parallel to your project, and to review similar business problems and their solutions. This can be assigned as homework at the end of the Understand phase or completed during the Sprint.</p>
                                                        <p>An example exercise: If your product is coffee, look at how other companies have described or categorized their product offering for chocolate.</p>
