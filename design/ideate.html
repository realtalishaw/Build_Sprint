												                                <p>Defining a shared understanding of Success Metrics is a vital step in the Design Sprint for the team to effectively problem solve together. Does your team have agreed-upon success metrics or signals? If yes, remind everyone of the goals. If not, use this time to list and agree on success metrics and signals. What is the difference between success metrics and signals? Signals relate to the general presence of a behavior that is desirable. Metrics are quantifiable, numeric outputs with regards to the desired behavior.</p>
                                                        <p>Google often uses the HEART method, which breaks down the process of creating metrics. It encourages the consideration of five categories when developing goals and corresponding metrics. These categories are: Happiness, Engagement, Acquisition, Retention, and Task completion.</p>

												                                <p>Every application has multiple user paths through it. All these paths are valid. The Golden Path, or the Key Usey Journey as it is also called, is the key set of steps that a user takes to find a product’s real value. This path should be the ideal default and not focus on exceptions or errors</p>
                                                        <p>In your team’s efforts to identify the golden path through your product, don’t think in terms of pages, think in terms of stories. This path should be easy and effortless. You may come across additional alternate path scenarios which are all valid optional outcomes. Prioritize the central flow of the product, not the secondary flows. The secondary experiences can be called supporting or red threads. Some examples of red threads are: creating an account, editing an order, updating your address.</p>
                                                        <p>The naming of this concept can vary in different methodologies, but the central idea is the same: knowing your product’s ideal path will help you focus your work.</p>

Boot Up Note Taking is the process of reviewing what’s been generated, collecting thoughts, and preparing to sketch ideas based on the knowledge and opportunities shared in the Understand phase.</p>
                                                        <p>By giving the team a moment to regroup, they won’t feel rushed and will be able to translate their ideas into visual form in the next steps.</p>

												                                <p>Crazy 8’s is a core Design Sprint method. It is a fast sketching exercise that challenges people to sketch eight distinct ideas in eight minutes. The goal is to push beyond your first idea, frequently the least innovative, and to generate a wide variety of solutions to your challenge.</p>
                                                        <p>Some team members without a design background may find this method intimidating at first, so it is helpful to reassure everyone that these are rough sketches. They do not need to be perfect or beautiful—sketches just need to communicate the idea. If necessary, you could even hold a quick “how to sketch” tutorial session before starting this exercise.</p>
                                                        <p>t’s also important to remember that the ideas do not have to be great. This exercise is about quieting the inner critic and giving our creative impulses space to flourish. Weird, impossible, and impractical ideas often give way to truly inspired ones. It’s called Crazy 8’s for a reason.</p>

												                                <p>The Solution Sketch is a Design Sprint method used to expand upon one solution idea. In this exercise, each team member spends more time articulating one idea they are most interested in, regardless of the most popular ideas identified from the Crazy 8’s sketches. It is okay to sketch a new idea or a combination of ideas, and a sketch can even include other people’s ideas.</p>
                                                        <p>The goal is to create one fully fleshed out idea for the solution that is thought to be the best. Each team member creates their own detailed Solution Sketch. A Solution Sketch should include three frames or states of the concept to help illustrate how it works, as well as a clear title to help people remember it.</p>
